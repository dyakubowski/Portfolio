# In the family tree, each person, except for the ancestor, has exactly one parent.
# Each element of the tree is associated with a non-negative integer called the height. The parent has a height of 0, any other element has a height 1 more than its parent.
# Given two elements in the tree. Determine if one of them is a descendant of the other.
# The program receives as input the number of elements in the family tree N. Then N âˆ’ 1 lines follow, specifying the parent for each element of the tree, except for the ancestor. 
# Each line is of the form descendant_name parent_name. Further to the end of the file there are lines containing the names of two elements of the tree.
# For each such query, output one of three numbers: 1 if the first element is the ancestor of the second, 2 if the second is the ancestor of the first, 
# or 0 if none of them is the ancestor of the other.
