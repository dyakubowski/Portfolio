# An isosceles right-angled triangle ABC with leg length d and point X are located on the coordinate plane. 
# The legs of the triangle lie on the coordinate axes, and the vertices are located at the points: A (0,0), B (d, 0), C (0, d).
# Write a program that determines the relative position of the X point and the triangle. If point X is located inside or on the sides of the triangle, output 0. 
# If the point is outside the triangle, output the number of the vertex closest to it.
# First, a natural number d (not exceeding 1000) is entered, and then the coordinates of the X point are two integers from the range from â€“1000 to 1000.
# If the point lies inside, on the side of the triangle, or coincides with one of the vertices, then output the number 0. 
# If the point lies outside the triangle, then output the number of the vertex of the triangle to which it is closest (1 - to the vertex A, 2 - to B, 3 - to C). 
# If the point is located at the same distance from two vertices, output the vertex whose number is less.
